                            At its core, Infy Galaxy OCR utilizes a multi-layered approach to Optical Character Recognition. Unlike traditional tools that rely solely on pattern matching, our platform integrates <strong>Vision Large Language Models (VLMs)</strong>. This means the system doesn't just "see" shapes; it "understands" the context of the document.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700">
                            By leveraging advanced AI models and tailored deep-learning algorithms, we achieve high accuracy even on challenging inputs like low-resolution scans, handwritten notes, and skewed images. This semantic understanding allows the tool to correct common OCR errors based on the surrounding sentence structure.
