## Technical Audit Findings
- **Implementation Pattern:** The available tools are built using the `GenericTool` component, which simplifies the addition of new conversion logic.
- **Frontend vs. Backend:** Most implemented tools operate client-side for privacy and speed. Adding the pending tools would involve extending the backend API or client-side conversion libraries.
- **Navigation:** The current navigation bar only lists 6 of the 8 implemented tools. `Image to Text` and `PDF to Text` are implemented but are not currently linked in the "Tools" dropdown menu (they are likely accessible via the main OCR interface or direct links).

## Recommendations
To reach the target of 30 tools, you should:
1. Update `components/navbar.tsx` to include all 8 currently implemented tools.
2. Prioritize implementation of the 22 pending tools using either existing client-side libraries or the backend processing API.
3. Update the `visitor` tracking API to account for all 30 tool types once they are active.
