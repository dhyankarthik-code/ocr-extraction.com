"Page Titles: Multiple","Issue","High","42","97.670","Pages which have multiple page titles. There should only be a single page title element for each page. Multiple page titles are often caused by multiple conflicting plugins or modules in CMS.","Remove the additional <title> tags from the pages HTML, ensuring the website has a single, concise and descriptive page title.",""
"Content: Readability Very Difficult","Opportunity","Low","2","4.650","Copy on the page is very difficult to read and best understood by university graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula. Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand.",""
"Directives: Outside <head>","Issue","High","1","1.350","Pages with a meta robots that is outside of the <head> element in the HTML. The meta robots should be within the <head> element, or search engines may ignore it. Google will typically still recognise meta robots such as a 'noindex' directive, even outside of the <head> element, however this should not be relied upon.","To ensure that search engines follow specified directives, include meta robots tags in the <head> element of a page's HTML.",""
"Security: Missing Secure Referrer-Policy Header","Warning","Low","74","98.670","URLs missing 'no-referrer-when-downgrade', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin', 'no-referrer' or 'strict-origin' policies in the Referrer-Policy header. When using HTTPS, it's important that the URLs do not leak in non-HTTPS requests. This can expose users to 'man in the middle' attacks, as anyone on the network can view them.","Consider setting a referrer policy of strict-origin-when-cross-origin. It retains much of the referrer's usefulness, while mitigating the risk of leaking data cross-origins.",""
"Canonicals: Missing","Warning","Medium","1","2.330","Pages that have no canonical URL present either as a link element, or via HTTP header. If a page doesn't indicate a canonical URL, Google will identify what they think is the best version or URL. This can lead to ranking unpredictability when there are multiple versions discovered, and hence generally all URLs should specify a canonical version","Specify a canonical URL for every page to avoid any potential ranking unpredictability if multiple versions of the same page are discovered on different URLs.",""
"Response Codes: Internal Redirection (3xx)","Warning","Low","1","1.300","Internal URLs which redirect to another URL. These will include server-side redirects, such as 301 or 302 redirects (and more). View URLs that link to redirects using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Redirection (3xx) inlinks'.","Ideally all internal links would be to canonical resolving URLs, and avoid linking to URLs that redirect. This reduces latency of redirect hops for users, and enhanced efficiency for search engines.",""
"H2: Non-Sequential","Warning","Low","26","60.470","Pages with an <h2> that is not the second heading level after the <h1> on the page. Heading elements should be in a logical sequentially-descending order. The purpose of heading elements is to convey the structure of the page and they should be in logical order from <h1> to <h6>, which helps navigating the page and users that rely on assistive technologies.","Ensure the <h2> is the second heading on the page. Headings should be in a logical sequential order from <h1> to <h6>. Review and update page heading levels so they are descending in order, for example the heading element following an <h1> should be an <h2>, rather than an <h3>.",""

Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand.",""
"Meta Description: Below 400 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","3","6.980","Pages which have meta descriptions much shorter than Google's estimated pixel length limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to communicate benefits, USPs or call to actions.","Consider updating the meta description to take advantage of the space left to include additional benefits, USPs or call to actions to improve click through rates (CTR).",""
"Page Titles: Over 561 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","22","51.160","Pages which have page titles over Google's estimated pixel length limit for titles in search results. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"URL: Over 115 Characters","Opportunity","Low","1","1.330","URLs that are more than the configured length. This is generally not an issue, however research has shown that users prefer shorter, concise URL strings.","Where possible use logical and concise URLs for users and search engines. However, changing URLs is a big decision, and often it's not worth changing them for SEO purposes alone. If URLs are changed, then appropriate 301 redirects must be implemented.",""
"Page Titles: Over 60 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","38","88.370","Pages which have page titles that exceed the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results and carry less weight in scoring.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"H2: Missing","Warning","Low","9","20.930","Pages which have a missing <h2>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h2> heading is often used to describe sections or topics within a document. They act as signposts for the user, and can help search engines understand the page.","Consider using logical and descriptive <h2>s on important pages that help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"H1: Over 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","3","6.980","Pages which have <h1>s over the configured length. There is no hard limit for characters in an <h1>, however they should be clear and concise for users and long headings might be less helpful","Write concise <h1>s for users, including target keywords where natural for users - without keyword stuffing.",""
"H1: Multiple","Warning","Medium","1","2.330","Pages which have multiple <h1>s. While this is not strictly an issue because HTML5 standards allow multiple <h1>s on a page, there are some problems with this modern approach in terms of usability. It's advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure. The classic HTML4 standard defines there should only be a single <h1> per page, and this is still generally recommended for users and SEO.","Consider updating the HTML to include a single <h1> on each page, and utilising the full heading rank between (h2 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"Page Titles: Outside <head>","Issue","High","1","2.330","Pages with a <title> element that is outside of the <head> element in the HTML. The page <title> should be within the <head> element, or search engines may ignore it. Google will often still recognise the page title even outside of the <head> element, however this should not be relied upon.","Ensure the page <title> element is in the <head> element of a page's HTML so that browsers can use it at the top of their window, and search engines can use it in scoring.",""
"Page Titles: Below 30 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","42","97.670","Pages which have page titles under the configured limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to target additional keywords or communicate your USPs.","Consider updating the page title to take advantage of the space left to include additional target keywords or USPs.",""
"Meta Description: Outside <head>","Issue","Medium","1","2.330","Pages with a meta description that is outside of the <head> element in the HTML. The meta description should be within the <head> element, or search engines may ignore it.","Ensure meta descriptions are in the <head> element of a page's HTML so that search engines can choose to use them for their search engine result page snippets.",""
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","28","65.120","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"Canonicals: Outside <head>","Issue","High","1","2.330","Pages with a canonical link element that is outside of the <head> element in the HTML. The canonical link element should be within the <head> element, or search engines will ignore it.","Ensure canonical link elements are in the <head> element of a page's HTML to be considered by search engines.",""
"Meta Description: Below 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","3","6.980","Pages which have meta descriptions below the configured limit. This isn't strictly an issue, but an opportunity.

"URL: Parameters","Warning","Low","1","1.330","URLs that include parameters such as '?' or '&'. This isn't an issue for Google or other search engines to crawl unless at significant scale, but it's recommended to limit the number of parameters in a URL which can be complicated for users, and can be a sign of low value-add URLs.","Where possible use a static URL structure without parameters for key indexable URLs. However, changing URLs is a big decision, and often it's not worth changing them for SEO purposes alone. If URLs are changed, then appropriate 301 redirects must be implemented.",""
"Canonicals: Canonicalised","Warning","High","1","2.330","Pages that have a canonical to a different URL. The URL is 'canonicalised' to another location. This means the search engines are being instructed to not index the page, and the indexing and linking properties should be consolidated to the URL in the canonical.","These URLs should be reviewed carefully to ensure the indexing and link signals are being consolidated to the correct URL. In a perfect world, a website wouldn't need to canonicalise any URLs as only canonical versions would be linked to internally on a website, but often they are required due to various circumstances outside of control, and to prevent duplicate content. Update internal links to canonical versions of URLs where possible.",""

"H2: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","25","58.140","Pages which have duplicate <h2>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful pages. If every page has the same <h2>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h2>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h2> for users and search engines.  If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate.",""
"Page Titles: Duplicate","Opportunity","Medium","42","97.670","Pages which have duplicate page titles. It's really important to have distinct and unique page titles for every page. If every page has the same page title, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate page titles as necessary, so each page contains a unique and descriptive title for users and search engines.
